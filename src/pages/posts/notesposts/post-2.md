##  Left hand typing

- why am i awake??? it's 12:58. I've been awake since 11 something. sigh. should I be skeptical of sleep that comes at 9?
- How do you load glass into a dishwasher? can swirling water break glass?
- I'm trying to use the trackpad with my left hand, type with one hand, right hand hurts from shoulder down
