# Post-Sucky-Sad Day Hangovers


- Yesterday was sucky. Woke up at 12 midnight today. Somewhat glad not be sad. Haven't cried this much in a while. Surprised myself a bit actually.
- I like my 3D printer
- I also really like Obsidian. There. I said it.
- Should I get a dog and build a sentient plant interface and never talk to a human again?
- And maybe a whale. And an elephant. 
- Is it possible to live a largely aquatic life with modern tech but one that doesn't trigger motion sickness? 
- Is there a way for a boat to like submerge into the water submarine style (not go too deep) to avoid storm based travel sickness?
- Do boats vary their depth in the water? Like how much of them is submerged?
