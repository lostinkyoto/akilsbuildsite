Here's a breakdown of the projects provided by Gemini- one per week

**Week 1: GitHub Productivity VS Code Extension**

- **Project Goal:** Create a VS Code extension that tracks your coding activity more accurately than the standard GitHub activity monitor.
- **Weekly Tasks:**
    - Research and design the extension's core functionality:
        - How will it track coding activity (e.g., keystrokes, active window focus, etc.)?
        - How will it create and manage the "code tracking" repository?
        - Determine the frequency of commits (e.g., every 30 minutes).
    - Set up the development environment for VS Code extension development.
    - Start building the basic framework of the extension.

**Week 2: Semantic Search of My Chat History**

- **Project Goal:** Develop an application that allows users to semantically search their chat history across various platforms (Slack, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger).
- **Weekly Tasks:**
    - Research data privacy and security implications.
    - Explore methods for securely collecting and storing user data (e.g., GDPR-compliant data requests).
    - Investigate embedding techniques for representing chat messages and queries.
    - Begin designing the user interface (UI) for the application.

**Week 3: Win My Argument**

- **Project Goal:** Build an AI-powered tool that helps users find relevant academic studies to support their arguments.
- **Weekly Tasks:**
    - Research and select a suitable dataset of academic abstracts (e.g., from arXiv.org).
    - Explore methods for efficiently storing and searching large volumes of text data.
    - Begin developing the core AI model for finding relevant studies based on user queries.
    - Design the user interface for the application.

**Week 4: AWS Supporter Chrome Extension**

- **Project Goal:** Create a Chrome extension that provides in-context assistance for navigating and using AWS services.
- **Weekly Tasks:**
    - Analyze the AWS user interface and identify key pain points.
    - Research and select an appropriate AI model for understanding user queries and providing step-by-step guidance.
    - Begin developing the Chrome extension's core functionality:
        - Interacting with the AWS UI.
        - Providing in-context guidance and highlighting relevant UI elements.

**Week 5: Domain Buying and Selling App**

- **Project Goal:** Develop a mobile app for buying and selling domains, inspired by Robinhood's stock trading interface.
- **Weekly Tasks:**
    - Research and select a domain registrar API for integrating with the app.
    - Design the user interface for the app, focusing on a sleek and user-friendly experience.
    - Begin developing the core functionality of the app:
        - Domain search and purchase.
        - Domain listing and selling.
        - User account management.

**Important Notes:**

- **Prioritize Open Source:** Ensure all projects are open-source to build trust and transparency.
- **Focus on User Experience:** Design user-friendly interfaces for all applications.
- **Document Your Progress:** Keep a detailed record of your work and any challenges encountered.
- **Seek Feedback:** Share your progress with others and solicit feedback.
