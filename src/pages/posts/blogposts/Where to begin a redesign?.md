# Where do I start?

# The first issue I have is- no clear problem statement

And I don't want to create one clear problem statement because I feel like I want to design like an everything palace. 


## solution a: lists.
One possible solution to this is to break the overall thing into smaller sub groups? Maybe a list of builds under the main build? Let's start (and see if this takes me anywhere):


### sub site list-
- Movie theatre website
- space for articles
- Movie reviews
- Build details
- Portfolio
- Online writing experiences
- Magazine like things
- Maybe a store?

### random feature list-
 - Toggle for story?
 - Blog posts with cool image things

### inspirational elements list-
- columbia ed side slide menu option
