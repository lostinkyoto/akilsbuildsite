# Where do I start?

# The first issue I have is- no clear problem statement

And I don't want to create one clear problem statement because I feel like I want to design like an everything palace. 

One possible solution to this is to break the overall thing into smaller sub groups? Maybe a list of builds under the main build? Let's start (and see if this takes me anywhere)
